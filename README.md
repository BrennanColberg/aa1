# Axis & Allies Dashboard

This website is designed to be displayed full-screen on a computer while a group plays the board game [Axis & Allies (1942, Revised)](https://www.amazon.com/Avalon-Hill-934824-Allies-Revised/dp/B00028X3HW/). It facilitates timekeeping and all aspects of economic bookkeeping (territory ownership, per-turn income, purchasing units, and seizing money upon conquering capitals). Additionally, on some browsers (where auto-play is not disabled), it plays the anthem of each country on repeat during its turn. It also saves all game data regularly, so that games can be started and continued at disjointed intervals without issue.

## Why use this dashboard?

With a normal game of Axis & Allies, there must be either a spreadsheet, a journal, or some form of tracking money (be it Monopoly money or coins or poker chips)... it's easy for the tracking of money to balloon into such a large issue that it clouds the joy of the game.

This software minimizes all of that; dedicated to tracking every aspect of a game's economy, players can -- and need -- focus only on strategy!

Additionally, it serves as a good decorative or thematic prop; even without any economic factors considered, it shows each country's name, flag, and color, and plays the appropriate anthem during their turn. 

## What about other versions of Axis & Allies?

The code is designed dynamically to adjust to different game structures; in the future, different versions of this classic game will be added, each with their own list of territories, list of nations, and purchasing opportunities. However, for now, the game uses only A&A Revised 1942.
